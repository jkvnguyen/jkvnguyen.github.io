				<h3> Stormcraft </h3>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h4> About </h4>


				<p> Stormcraft is a multiplayer battle arena strategy game proof of concept for a mobile. You, the player, play as a selected hero with the ability to cast unique spells and spawn minions to target objectives.

					<b> <i> Platform:  PC, mobile </i> </b>

					<br>
					<b> <i> Responsibilities: game design, level design, story writing, concept art, 3D modelling, programming, technical writing </i> </b>

					<br>
					<b> <i> Length: two months </i> </b>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				<h4 > What I did: </h4>

				<ul>
					<li> Created character concepts, design, and model. </li>

					<li> Designed and implemented basic game mechanics.  </li>
					<li> Developed levels, textures and models. </li>
					<li> Wrote the story and project documents. </li>
				</ul>




				<div style="margin-bottom: 10px"> </div>



								<br>
								<br>
				<h5 > Character Design </h5>
				<br>

 			 <p> We wanted to design the non-human factions first because these faction
 				 help enable more unique abilities. Although humans can possess unique abilities using a bit of imagination, we wanted to show a clear
 				 distinction of race (via the story) as a central theme of the game and emphasize it more using epic fantasy. Because of the game's story being played
 				 out as epic fantasy, we wanted to use this opportunity to design something that was unique to our game.
 			 </p>




				 <br>
 			 <h4> Ezrae </h4>

 			 <p>
 				 Initially I had intended to design Ezrae as physically imposing as to change the narrative of female characters as seen as fragile.
 				 However by design of her origins (story), it had made more sense if she had a simple slim fit look. As someone coming from a poor background,
 				 it would have been more likely she'd be somewhat underfed her life and would not have been able to sustain strong muscle mass. As such, her
 				 abilities come from the story's idea of 'Blessings' where in a population only some people are born with these 'Blessings' which enable
 				 them to special powers. For Ezrae specifically, her Blessing, the Blessing of Fortitude, she possesses supernatural strength, endurance, and speed.
 				 As a Fortician, she also possesses the ability to absorb spells and redistritube them to her own weapons. This effect I wanted to look light blue to
 				 represent energy field that is absorbing magic/spells.
 					 <br>
					 <br>

 				 As a human hero, Ezrae's design draws inspiration from Brandon Sanderson's <span class="italics"> Mistborn</span>'s Vin.
 				 Conceptually Ezrae is supposed to be seen as fragile so she wears light and vulnerable armor. However, she is
 				 physically strong making her opponents underestimate her. She possesses supernatural abilities (magic) and her lightweight equipment lend to her fighting style which
 				 utilizes agility.

 			 <h5> Game Mechanics </h5>
			 <br>
			 <br>


 			 <h4> Heroes </h4>

 			 <p> There are 4 factions players can choose from and play (currently 2). Among those factions are a variety (thinking 3 each faction) of heroes the player can select from to choose as their main hero.
 			 Each factions' heroes possess unique abilities similarly to the <span class="italics"> Warcraft III </span> design. Heroes possess 2 types of abilities. Their own unique abilities and abilities
 			 shared across each faction's underlings (let's call minions). Unique abilities are specific only to a certain hero. Heroes will possess 2 unique abilities. Abilities shared across faction heroes are
 			 what "divides" to help you conquer. You, the hero, summon/spawn 3 different types of minions that help you control and win the game.

 			</p>
			<br>

 			<h4 > Minions </h4>

 			<p>There are 3 types of minions the hero can spawn: the infantry unit, range unit, and heavy unit. Model follows similarly to both Warcraft III and Starcraft designs, where a specific
 			types counter other types. Ideally, our group had wanted 4 different factions, where each faction's minion types are all different and counter types are unique depending on <thead>
 				faction the player is playing against but due to time constraints we went with only 2 factions for now. When a unit is "countered" units that counter another unit deal extra amount of damage
 				to that specific unit. </p>

				<br>
 				So let's say infantry unit = 1, range = 2, heavy = 3.
 				 <br>
 				In a Faction 1(F1) vs. Faction 2(F2) scenario: <br>
 				<br>
 				F1-1 counters F2-3 <br>
 				F1-2 counters F2-2 <br>
 				F1-3 counters F2-1 <br>
 				F2-1 counters F1-2 <br>
 				F2-2 counters F1-1 <br>
 				F2-3 counters F1-3

 				<br>
				<br>
 				<p>the counters can be seen as such. We wanted to have interesting gameplay by using these types of counters such
 				player would have to intelligently summon their minions in such a way that the counters can be avoided.</p>

				<br>
				<br>

 				<h5 > Combat System </h5>
				<br>
				<br>


 				<div class="spacing"> </div>
 				<span class="italics"> Video demo of initial level designs, combat system, and AI. </span>
 				<div class="spacing"> </div>

 				<p>
 					Like mentioned above, the combat system follows a unit counter theme; where different unit of different factions counter each other based on who they deal damage to.

 				</p>

 				<p>
 					For towers, outer towers do less damage than inner towers. This is to encourage that heroes don't just run through the outer towers and ignore them. Inner tower damage is reduced
 					based on the numbers of outer towers destroyed to encourage more strategical lines of attack as opposed to attacking one location.
 				</p>

				<br>
 				<h4 > Field of View </h4>

 				<p> To enabled combat, each unit possesses a field of view. <p>

 					<!-- <div class=pic-center>
 						<img src="img/stormcraft/concept7.jpg" width=400 style="margin-right: 5px;">
 					</div> -->

 					<p> Field of view uses a ray caster that traces over a 3D sphere and determines if there are obstacles and objects within the object's field of view.
 					</p>

					<br>
 					<h4> Towers / Nexus </h4>

 					<p> Outer towers deal less than inner towers if both are standing/alive. Inner towers' damage are reduced to
 					the same as outer towers if all outer towers are destroyed. Inner tower damage is reduced based on numbers of outer tower destroyed. </p>

					<p>
 					At least one inner tower must be destroy for the Nexus to be attacked. In the case where players try
 					to circumvent this, Nexus will gain invulnerablility. </p>

					<br>
 			<h4 > Level Design </h4>

 			<p>
 				The level design we based off of MOBA styled games. We used <i> League of Legends </i>, <i> DOTA 2 </i>, and
	 				<i> Heroes of the Storm</i> as inspirations for map detail and general gameplay. Initial sketches for level designed followed
 				 League of Legends' outer towers and inner nexus tower. Maps are enclosed by towers and main base, called Nexus, is what players are trying to destroy/protect to win.
 			</p>


 			<p> A brief technical system of the idea of how the game progresses. Different player's heroes move around the map and manuever around towers and against each
 			other to best optimize attacks. Nexus indicated by the border surrounding the tower. Initial concept for Nexus had Nexus dealing damage but TBD for balance changes. </p>

		</div>

 			<br>
			<br>

 			<p> <b> Start: </b> Players spawn are mirrored and players spawn at the Nexus (for sake of showing the hero more clearly the
 					diagram shows the heroes on the corners)</p>

					<br>




					<h4 > Concluding Notes </h4>

					<p> The game was developed as a proof of concept as completing the whole game would require more than two months.</p>
