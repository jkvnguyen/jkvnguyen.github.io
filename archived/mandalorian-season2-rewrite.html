					<h4> Context </h4>

			 	 <br>
			 	 <p>
			 		 I was a big fan of The Mandalorian season 1 but season 2? Well, it got a bit too fan service-y and lost a lot of its Western cowboy-samurai vibes and exploration of a darker Star Wars narrative.
					  Here is my rewrite of season 2 broken down up to episode 4.
			 	 </p>

				 <br>

				 <h4> Episode 1: The Search </h4>

				<br>
				<p>
					The Mandalorian has been tasked with returning the Child to its people, the Jedi. He begins searching for other Guild leaders on recommendation by Greef Karga for higher bounties, ones of which may know of who the Jedi were. His first lead, formerly Imperial planet, Aloxor, is well-known for its criminal activities and his contact is Guild Leader, Randolf. He meets Randolf where in exchange for a special vial at an ex-Imperial laboratory he will tell him what he knows about the Jedi. At the lab, he discovers the base is being used to conduct experiments on local criminals, explaining why crime rates in town have been so low, with a vial containing something called an M-count. Stealthily, the Mandalorian retrieves a sample of one of the vials but notices the Child whimpering. He decides to investigate the laboratory further but is seen by patrolling guards. He quickly escapes the laboratory and returns to Randolf to exchange. On his way, he discovers that Randolf and his guild are dead. Murdered by lasers, he suspects the work of Imperial troops and Randolf knowing too much. Looking at the vial in his hand, the Mandalorian walks away to his ship.

				</p>


			 	<br>

				<h4> Episode 2: The Vial </h4>

				<br>
				<p>
					The Mandalorian follows his second lead, another Guild leader, to the planet, Panna. He meets Poku, the Guild leader, and shows him the vial. Poku denies knowing anything about the vial and that instead he has a special bounty he would like the Mandalorian to complete in exchange for a contact who may know what the vial is. The Mandalorian agrees to the bounty to eliminate a local vigilante. Poku’s coordinates lead him to a large warehouse where he finds it is empty. A large group of mercenaries attack the Mandalorian and Poku reveals himself that he has ordered a hit on the Mandalorian citing that the vial is extremely expensive and that the Mandalorian’s beskar armor would also add nicely to his profits. The Mandalorian easily incapacitates the Guild members and mercenaries and asks Poku what he knows. Poku tells him of a person called the Donor who the new Galactic empire has been retrieving M-count vials from. The Mandalorian leaves the warehouse to return back to his ship. Nearby, a hooded figure is seen watching from shadows.


				</p>
				<br>


				<h4> Episode 3: The Old Man </h4>

				<br>
				<p>
					With no leads to who the Donor may be, the Mandalorian begins his search for other Mandalorians in hopes that their connections can help him find the Donor or the Jedi. He finishes his last recommendation from Greef Karga on the planet, Orra, but finds no answers. He leaves for Nevarro instead to make contact with Greef Karga on any leads to the Donor. He reunites with Cara Dune who has now joined the New Republic who has a potential lead regarding a Mandalorian on the planet Corvus. On Corvus, Mando asks the townspeople about where he can find the other Mandalorian but gets no leads. On a walk down the road, Mando is attacked by a flying bounty hunter who he begins to fight. The person who he fights with, he notices is only an older man but wearing a Mandalorian jetpack. Mando demands that he hands over the jetpack but the man fights him off. The two fight until the man stops when he sees the Child. The man asks what he is doing with a Jedi and what he wants with him. Mando explains that he has been tasked with returning this child back to its people as a way of the creed. The man however explains that the Jedi are not a race but their own creed and that they went extinct during the purge. As Mando seeks to find more answers the man flies away.



				</p>
				<br>

				<h4> Episode 4: The Past </h4>

				<br>
				<p>
					Mando continues his search looking for the old man but has lost his trail. Frustrated at his result, he returns to Nevarro to seek a Guild bounty to replenish his funds. His Guild bounty is as a bodyguard to protect an important shipment from pirates. He boards a large carrier where he is assigned to patrol and guard a portion of the ship. However while patrolling he is followed by a small child who is very fascinated by him. The child, named Jash, is the son of the carrier’s captain, and mimics everything Mando does. Thinking about his own childhood, there is a flashback highlighting Mando’s hardships as he trained in the ways of the creed and how other children of the creed were raised to fight. Distracted and thinking about his own child (Baby Yoda), the carrier is ambushed and Mando prepares to fight. Worrying for the safety of the child, Mando tells him to return to his father where he will be safe. Mando methodically takes out the pirates and before he could finish some of them off the rest of them all retreat. Mando checks the other areas of the ship and finds that everything is intact. He returns to the captain’s room where he now finds the child crying behind his father. Mando reminiscences about his own past again and a time when he also cried like that once.
