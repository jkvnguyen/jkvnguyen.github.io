            <h4> background </h4>
            <p> With the popularity of social media platforms such TikTok and Instagram, NexTech wanted to explore the uses of Augmented Reality in a social medium. Using collaborations with current and past clients, the app would help feature different brands and products to promote and showcase content on an all-purpose app. </p>

            <br>
            <h4> takeaways</h4>
            <p> A challenge that came from designing this application would be the onboarding process. Augmented Reality is a relatively new technology, and many people may not be familiar with it. For this app, a variety of different AR experiences are featured and each of them have their own unique use cases. I would research the different use cases: for AR portals, AR image tracking, and spawning 3D objects, and apply my findings to a set of detailed instructions for each. Detailed instructions for each of the experiences are shown before the experience is activated which allowed for a more universal design categorized based on AR content type.</p>

            <p>Working alongside developers and product managers, an important lesson from this experience was communication. While pencil and paper served well, design software simply allowed for a better presentation to receive feedback and for iteration of designs. With team meetings being hosted every week, it was important that I gathered as much feedback as possible. Design is an iterative process and communication allows for better design processes and progresses the app closer to the desired product. </p>

              <h4> background </h4>
              <p> NexTech hoarded an abundance of content outside of AR. Ranging from text media, images, to videos, the cataloguing of all these mediums needed to find a home. AR University provided a potential solution to organizing all available content and using past collaborations to promote products in a more educational way.</p>

              <br>
              <h4> takeaways</h4>
              <p>
              Originally the idea for the app was conceptualized as filter system for the various mediums. However, as a consumer it did not feel like a learning module. One of the challenges during this process was communicating with my product manager and convincing them of making the app more procedural in its process. Providing my own feedback, I learned a lot while defending my designs. Knowing the process of another perspective can point out some of the potential problems with the product that one may not see. Development of a large product is a team process. If people are not in sync, it can cause major issues.</p>

              <h4> background </h4>
              <p> The development of AR face-tracking technology helped launch NexTech into the e-commerce world. With wearables such as glasses and hats being made into 3D models, it was only a matter of time before such features were included in online shopping tools. At NexTech, I was tasked with designing the interface for their concept (dummy) e-commerce product page and creating a usable user experience for new online shoppers.</p>

              <br>
              <h4> takeaways</h4>
              <p>
              With previous designs with onboarding users to AR, the process here was developed much more quickly and efficiently. The majority of the research was spent researching various e-commerce products and how products are sold. Further research was looked into competitors who used AR as part of their product browsing. PC Web products were less likely to feature AR because not everyone owns a webcam.</p>

                <br>
              <p>
              While I wasn’t at NexTech long, I learned a lot in the role of UI/UX designer. From the software tools such Sketch and InVision to communicating with developers and product managers, the role requires a lot of attention and ability to gather feedback. Coming from a technical background, the position gave me a great deal of perspective in the designer’s shoes and how as a developer, design thinking is applied in product development. I learned a lot especially in the Augmented Reality medium and I wish to improve my skills in design!</p>
