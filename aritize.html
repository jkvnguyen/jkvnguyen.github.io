				<h3> ARitize </h3>

				<br>

				<h4 > What I did: </h4>

				<br>

				<p>
          Developed the UI/UX for an Augmented Reality mobile platform designed to increase brand awareness, customer engagement, and online sales.


        </p>

					<ul>
						<li> Researched a variety of different social media and Augmented Reality apps and applied successful design trends to be used as part of designing ARitize</li>
						<li> Provided detailed explanations for onboarding Augmented Reality experiences for users who were unfamiliar with AR along with the app </li>
						<li> Designed pages for: home, subscriber profile, user profile, the Augmented Reality experiences, categories/featured, search filter, QR Scan & Code protection</li>
						<li> Developed a clickable prototype for team members to use and give feedback on </li>

					</ul>

	 <strong> Notice: </strong> Current iteration may not reflect these designs but are based on them.

				<br>
				<br>

				<h4 > Brainstorming + Design Goals </h4>

				<br>

				<p>
				Before these designs, ARitize was simply an app that only held Augmented Reality experiences without an organized system to display the experiences and mostly served as a proof
				of concept. Experiences were categorized only by brands but this was not the overall vision the company had envisioned and aims for the app would begin as:


				</p>

				<ol style="text-align: left;">
					<li> The Instagram of AR - a social media platform for everyone to showcase AR </li>
					<li> Brand + Portfolio Showcase - Target audience would be for brands and developers hoping to showcase their products and portfolio to share </li>
					<li> Live streaming service - Users would be able to stream AR content live as a hologram and experience live streams as virtual spectators </li>
					<li> Promotional and QR codes that could be entered and scanned to join specific channels and experiences </li>
					<li> Location based QR/promotional code to be scanned in person and on live products to be used for discounts</li>
					<li> Channel/profiles hold Augmented Reality experiences </li>
					<li> Each experience is categorized by a tag and category to be used by a search engine</li>


				</ol>

				<br>
				<p> With these ideas and intentions for the app established, the design goals would include: </p>

				<ul>
					<li> Create an onboarding experience that describes the app and educates them about AR</li>
					<li> Provide extensive information on AR use such as lighting and plane detection to properly enable AR</li>
					<li> Develop a channel system that is easy to use and navigate - subscription/following based </li>
					<li> Add menu items that are consistent with other social media platforms </li>
					<li> Create a QR scan and Code page that is consistent with design trends</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h4> Menu Bar</h4>
				<br>

				<p> The menu bar consists of top and bottom component to create symmetry and act as containers to hold clickable buttons.
					The top component contains icons for a search, app logo, and profile. The bottom component contains a home, code, and scan icons.
				 </p>

				 <p>
					 	<b>Buttons: </b>
				 </p>

				 <ul style="text-align: left; list-style: inside;">
					 <li> A <b>Search</b> button that goes to a search page revealing featured content and the ability to search specific content</li>
					 <li> <b>Home</b> button that goes to the default page when the app is loaded. Home page contains content for user's current followings/subscription showing if
					 new content is available or if a channel is currently doing a live stream</li>
					 <li> <b>Code </b> button that prompts a "enter a code" text prompt for users to enter a code. Entering the correct code will lead users to private content that
					 cannot be indexed via searched or by normal subscription style format. Pages for entering a code are either the AR experience itself or the channel of the AR experience </li>
					 <li> <b>Scan</b> button is the same as the code button. </li>
					 <li> <b>Profile</b> button goes to a profile page displaying the list of the user's account information such as email and ability to change password and logout. Profile page also
					 includes options for viewing user's channel own AR content and the list of channels that user is subscribed too. </li>
					 <li> <b>ARitize logo </b> is present simply as a branding style to promote the app more publicly</li>
				 </ul>


				 <br>
				 <h4> Home Page</h4>
				 <br>

				 <p> The default page when the app is first loaded. It contains a list of all content from the list of followings/channels the user is currently subscribed to. The page is formatted
					 in a two column format because it best displays the channel's logo increasing brand awareness. Each channel is designed in its own block with a square logo and name underneath. Channel and channel text are all clickable and goes to the channel page
					 revealing all content of that channel. Live/new content will be highlighted with a small banner on the home page
					 showing 'New' or 'Live'. Overflowing channels will simply be scrollable.

					</p>

					<br>
	 			 <h4> Channel Page</h4>
	 			 <br>

	 			 <p> Channel page holds content for a channel's page and designed with a small profile pic and banner image (used to promote promotions) at the top as a menu top bar. Additional text
					 is displayed below the profile pic giving the user a way to provide context to their channel and promote any promotional text or events. Content is assorted in a one column display and
					 AR experiences are presented in individual blocks with preview for the AR experience.

	 				</p>

					<br>
				 <h4> AR Experience </h4>
				 <br>

				 <p> The AR experiences all remains the same with the exception of sequential onboarding text giving detailed explanations of how to setup the experience and use AR and some
					 additional UI buttons for additional info, help, and share.

					 <br>
					 <br>
					 Text for the AR:

					 <ol style="text-align: left;">
 						<li> Ensure there is sufficient lighting and that you are pointing your device on a flat surface. </li>
						<li> (Once flat service detected) Tap to place. </li>

				 	</ol>



					</p>

					<p>
						Additional info simply shows any additional text that exists for the experience by the channel. Help provides additional information on how to use and setup the experience. Sharing
						sets a screenshot of the experience and sends it via a variety of social media platforms.
					</p>

					<h4> Search Page</h4>
					<br>

					<p> Search page filters the result of the text inputted and lists experience with the same or similar text input. Search displays the searched elements in the same manner as the profile page
						showed in a single column and experiences are listed out within that column.

					 </p>

				<br>
					<h4 class="subheader"> Notes </h4>


					<br>
					<p>Due to confidentiality problems, drafts are not available but if you want me to go through the design process, feel free to contact me! </p>
