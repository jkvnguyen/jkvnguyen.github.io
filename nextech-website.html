							<h4 class="subheader"> Home Page</h4>
		<br>

							<p>
								Home page features a call to action (CTA) as its first item such that consumers are given the option to easily click on CTAs to generate leads.
							The design follows up with a last of brands that the company has worked with; giving consumers an idea about the popularity of the service and potentially
						more trust as to who uses the service. The products are then listed below the brands' tags; done in a quilt block styled format such that when the user
					lands on the home page, they are given a larger overview (by seeing more products) of what the service may offer due to the smaller design space with more products displayed
						and are given more context as to what to purchase/use.

		<br>
		<br>

						The menu bar consists of the relevant tabs: home, products, investors, media (was later added), blog, and contact.
						Home menu: for a site reset; products tab: to reveal a list of products, also works as a dropdown (although a bit redundent); investors tab as per requested by management; blogs for interesting news and notes on NexTech and
						the technology; media: articles about NexTech; Contact Us: CTA for lead generation.

						<br>
						<br>

						Social media icons are for those interested in the technology/events NexTech has been recently involved in and provides a sense of culture a consumer may about NexTech if they are interested in using their service.

						<br>
						<br>

						Images are royalty free pictures. Note: Content was lackluster in the company's conception.

						<br>
						<br>

						Footer simply is a encapsulated version of the menu that also provides the user to contact the company for further consultation about products by subscribing to an email list or in-person. Included are also the policies and legalities that comes
						when providing a service.

	      <h4 class="subheader"> Products </h4>
	      <br>

	      <p> Products feature a products page, and five products: AR for E-commerce, ARitize App, AR for Retail, AR for Livestream, and AR for University (e-Learning). Products page is a page that encapsulates all the products in a list
					ordering the five products from most to least important in terms of sales. This page simply acts as guide to provide more context regarding a specific product whereas the home page may simply only have promotional text that
					may not be quite specific for users who are looking to learn more.
	      </p>
<br>

	      <div class="spacing"> </div>

	      <img src="img/nextech-site/2-Products.png" width=500>


				<br>
	      <br>

	      <p> The five product pages follow the same format: Call to action, image + text blocks alternating, testimonies, and news. The CTA is obvious as we want to generate leads. The image behind it also provides a little bit of context and should be used as a capture such that it does generate leads.
	        This gives the user a visual reference as to what the product does/is along with text to provide more context.
	        Testimonies and news about the product are followed after the description blocks and images to give user a sense of the possible things consumers can do themselves using a 3rd party as reference and
	        news about the product can provide more context about the consensus/facts/data about the product.
	       </p>

						<h4 class="subheader"> Investors Page </h4>
						<br>

						 <p>
							 The format of the investors page follows: CTA Block w/ Stock ticker info & subtab, About Us Block, Corporate Team Block, Press Release Block, Events Block.
							 <br>
							 <br>

							 CTA Block used to generate leads and provide additional info about the company's stock rates via a link. Subtab is used for a more easily accessible resource readily available without the investors needing to search for it as much. About Us block is self-explanatory as it describes the company and its direction and allows investors with context as to who/why they may be looking to invest in.
							 Corportate team allow investors to more easily connect with important people in the company and the press release and events block depict news about the company and where investors may find news about them or meeting them at a neaby event. In some of these blocks, there are
							 CTAs that allow investors to see more information about the different kinds of events, press releases, and resources.
							</p>

							<br>

							<h5> Press Releases, Events, & Resources </h5>
							<br>
						 <p> Press releases and events are designed similarly using only Title, brief description, and either audio/pdfs download or a category. Just a simple and elegant way to display press releases and events as content is presented in chronological order as rows emphasizing the most recent events as to
						 keep investors updated on the most recent news on the company. Resources is just a simple fact sheet for investors to use to learn additional information about the company. </p>

					<br>

	        <p> Blog follows a simple 3x3 format of blogs each with a title, author, brief description, and image of the blog.
	        Design was implemented this way where the image would be the highlight of blog as we want to attract people to the technology and the best way to do so is by
	        giving users a visual along with a brief description to be used as tease and more context.
